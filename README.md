# Which Universities Did Popular British Comedians Go To?
I watch a lot of British TV. I realized the other day that quite a few British comedians share the same two alma matersâ€”Cambridge and Oxford. That's not something I'd noticed among US comedians. The graphic below shows comedians who have been on tour or who have been on panel shows, talks shows, game shows, or radio shows. They're ones I've seen one or more times, and the list is by no means exhaustive.
